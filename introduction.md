    - was originally a **community-driven project** that aimed to provide a free, open-source version of RHEL. It was binary-compatible with RHEL, meaning it shared the same codebase without the branding or support services from Red Hat
    - free, open-source

  - **Fedora**
    - is a community-driven linux distribution sponsored by Red Hat. It serves as the upstream source for RHEL. Many of the features and technologies that will eventually appear in RHEL first show up in Fedora.
    - Cutting-edge software and features
    - Rapid development cycle with new releases every 6 months
